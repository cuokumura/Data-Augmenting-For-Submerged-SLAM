# Data Augmentation to Improve Underwater SLAM Performance

## Overview 
This repository contains our code for our final project for EECS 568: Mobile Robotics during the Winter 2024 Semester at the University of Michigan. Our team is made up of:
* Christopher Okumura (cokumura@umich.edu): ECE Master's (Specialization: Robotics).
* Tiffany Parise (tparise@umich.edu): ECE Master's (Specialization: Computer Vision).
* Daphne Tsai (dvtsai@umich.edu): CSE Master's student.

## Download the AQUALOC Datset
The AQUALOC dataset can be found [here](https://www.lirmm.fr/aqualoc/). Please download the appropiate files.

## ORB-SLAM 3

## Data Augmentation 
We will perform two data augmentations on the AQUALOC dataset: contrast and brightness. Below are the directions to perform the augmentations.

### Contrast

### Brightness
We will use two different deep learning models for brightness enhancement. The directions are as follows:

#### EnlightenGAN

#### Zero-DCE
